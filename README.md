# Garrysmod-AntiFreeze-Python
LINUX ONLY!<br>
Kills the srcds process so it can restart if your server is frozen by a malicious or accidental abuse of physics.
Put this inside your data folder and create an `antifreeze` folder.  The python script has 1 argument which is your server's port.

The LUA file goes in your lua/autorun/server folder
